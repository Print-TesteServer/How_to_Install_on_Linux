Hello, I recently migrated from Windows to Linux and was having difficulty installing Pygame_gui on it, I found the way to install it using
the pip shown in the README.md      repository pygame_gui: https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui

(I'm sorry for any translation error, I'm Brazilian)


    INSTALL PIP FOR PYTHON 2

First, make sure you have Python 2 installed. On Ubuntu, use the command below to check.

    python2 --version

If there is no error and valid output showing the Python version, you will have Python 2 installed. So now you can install pip for Python 2 using this command:

    sudo apt install python-pip

It will install the pip and a number of other dependencies with it. Once installed, make sure you have the pip installed correctly.

    pip --version

It should show a version number, something like this:

    pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)

This shows that you have successfully installed pip on Ubuntu.

    INSTALLING PIP FOR PYTHON 3

You have to make sure that Python 3 is installed on Ubuntu. To check this, use this command:

    python3 --version

If it shows a number like Python 3.6.6, Python 3 is installed on your Linux system.

You can now install pip3 using the command below:

    sudo apt install python3-pip

You must verify that pip3 was installed correctly using this command:

    pip3 --version

It should show you a number like this:

    pip 9.0.1 from / usr / lib / python3 / dist-packages (python 3.6)

This means that pip3 has been successfully installed on your system.
